# CS-370

The included project in the repository is a pathfinder program which has some code that was given out through the course and some that I wrote. The majority of the Q-Learning is code that I wrote along with setting up the algorithm that the agent follows to find the optimal solution to the maze. The rest of the code was given to me.

Computer Scientist are the developers that take a deep look at the internals of a program and otimize it with correct algorithms, and data structs, etc. 
Unlike software engineers, computer scientist tend to take a more focused view of a program to find the places that can be fixed and made better. This matters because it takes a certain amount of resources to run a program and if a computer scientist can reduce those resources then they can make the program more profitable for their employer.

I tend to approach a prorblem is a logical manner. Depending on what I'm doing I will attempt to understand what I need to do and what is stopping me from doing that. Then I will either find the fix to the problem or plan out the steps I will need to do to fix said problem. Obviously there are minor steps inbetween but I tend to try and keep things as simple as possible so that problems don't occure because of complexity.

My responsibilities to the end user are to complete my work to the best of my abilities and to ensure that I keep to Best Prectices so that if there is ever a question about the integrity of my work then I can at least say that I followed the rules. Also I need to do what the client wants not what I think they want because the customer is allways right.
